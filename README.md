# Numerical-Pyramid

This is a high-school assignment.
We have to develop a Math Pyramid puzzle solver, abusing Object Oriented Programming as much as possible.
A puzzle of this kind consists of a pyramid of cells with numbers in them.
The number written on each cell is calculated by adding up the numbers of the cells exactly below them.
